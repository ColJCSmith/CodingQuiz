Description:

The first step in developing this coding quiz was putting all the questions and answers into an object.
Then I researched the logic to select the correct answer from a range of answers in an object.  This drew on a number of sources, including https://jsfiddle.net/anthkris/3fnzdnun/
Next, I built a timer to count down from 60 seconds.  Then I added an if loop, to reduce 5 seconds for every wrong answer.  
I then added the feature to display score at zero and hide the 'next' button.
I added an input box to capture the player's score and initials, then add them to local storage.
Finally, I added a new High Score page, with a link from the index page.

Next steps, if there was time, would be to tidy up the CSS file.
